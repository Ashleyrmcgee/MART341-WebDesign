            <h1> Welcome to Luke's </h1>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Luke's Diner is a busy eatery situated in the centre of Stars Hollow. It is owned by Luke Danes, who inherited his father's Hardware Store and turned it into a diner. Lorelai and Rory are frequent customers at Luke's, eating there most days. They often have burgers, fries, and baked goods. Luke is also their main supplier of coffee.

                The diner is popular and a mainstay for the townspeople. Luke's coffee particularly receives high praise. Despite Luke's frequent irritation with him, Kirk is a regular customer and has his first date in years at the diner, citing that he feels comfortable there. </p>
