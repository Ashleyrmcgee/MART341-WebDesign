<hr>

<p>Ella Minnow Pea is a girl living happily on the fictional island of Nollop off the coast of South Carolina. Nollop was named after Nevin Nollop, author of the immortal pangram,* "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." </p>
   <p> Now Ella finds herself acting to save her friends, family, and fellow citizens from the encroaching totalitarianism of the island's Council, which has banned the use of certain letters of the alphabet as they fall from a memorial statue of Nevin Nollop. </p>
    As the letters progressively drop from the statue they also <b>disappear from the novel</b>. The result is both a hilarious and moving story of one girl's fight for freedom of expression, as well as a linguistic tour de force sure to delight word <em> everywhere.</em>

<p> I loved this perky, word-exacting fable; it was a quick read--a touch zany at times but thoroughly enjoyable. </p>

<p>And yes, I did intentionally use all the letters of the alphabet in the first sentence. It is, admittedly, harder than it seems.

The book is in the form of letters written among the inhabitants of a small island nation who prize, above all, their literary and vocabulary skills. 
</p> 

<p>When letters begin to fall from the city's motto (The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog), the city council takes it as a divine message to remove those letters from the language.

The story continues as additional letters fall. The few residents fight to restore the lost letters to the alphabet while trying to maintain their frequent letters with increasingly fewer letters from with to draw. </p>

I didn't expect to like it as much as I did but I found myself quite taken with the story. Despite being crunched for shelf space, this book is one I'll be adding to my personal library; the copy I read will sadly have to be returned to the public library. </p>
