        <p class="box"> Elephants normally use their trunks to siphon up water and squirt it into their mouths, which helps them avoid such a vulnerable position. This baby can't do that yet, however, so it's just hydrating the only way it knows how.</p>
        <p class="box"> "When an elephant is born, it is not able to control the use of its trunk and it will flop around as they try different techniques to control it," according to the KOTA Foundation, a nonprofit focused on raising awareness about African elephants.</p>
